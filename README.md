# World's first AI portfolio 🤖✨

**Static portfolios are dead.**

Instead of making you scroll endlessly, my portfolio adapts to *you*.
Ask a question — my AI avatar replies instantly.

## 👇 What can you ask?

- 🧠 **Tech recruiter?** Ask about my stack & results
- 💻 **Dev?** Dive into my code & mindset
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Friend or family?** See what I’ve been working on

---

This is not a portfolio.
It’s a **conversation tailored to your curiosity**.
